Hi everyone 👋

I’m a 1st year BTech student and I’ve realized I want to seriously start learning new things outside my syllabus and build a habit of continuous growth.

I’m looking to start something small and practical — maybe a mini project, understanding stock market basics, or any beginner-friendly challenge that builds consistency.

If you were in your first year again:

What small project or habit would you start?

Any beginner-friendly ideas (tech / finance / productivity / skills)?

How do I stay consistent without getting overwhelmed?

Would love suggestions, resources, advices. Thanks in advance!
